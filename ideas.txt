Just some notes to avoid loosing them. =)

KRunner based search:
	- Reuse application runner, extend it to lookup also keywords and long description
	- <aseigo> and maybe only do the description search if the keyword/genericname search comes up empty
	- Also:
		<aseigo> ugh ugh ugh http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-1.0.html#recognized-keys
		<aseigo> nothing useful
		<aseigo> that should be extended at a minimum with Keywords
