Just some notes to avoid loosing ideas. =)

KRunner based search:
	- Reuse application runner, extend it to lookup also keywords and long description
	- <aseigo> and maybe only do the description search if the keyword/genericname search comes up empty
 	- Also:
		<aseigo> ugh ugh ugh http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-1.0.html#recognized-keys
		<aseigo> nothing useful
		<aseigo> that should be extended at a minimum with Keywords (note by ruphy: extend also with "long description")

TOM:
	- Query KBuildsycoca for all Programs
	- Query Nepomuk after for Database-/Ranking- and Task-Information
	- Use standard categories for 4.2, try to rationalize the menu for later versions.
		* Basic usability rule: 5 items perfect, 7 maximum. Try to make the current (silly) menu
		  get into those bounds by extensively using subgroups.




...and more to come!
